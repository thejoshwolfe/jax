### Josh's Jax japerator grammar definition file
###

## how the grammar works:
## four types of grammar elements:
## 	scalar:
## 	 declaration prefixed with "$"
##   elements listed delimited by whitespace
##   indicates that all elements should appear in the order specified
##  list:
##   declaration prefixed with "~"
##   element type and delimiter token specified with a ":" between them
##   indicates that zero or more occurrences of the element appear separated by the delimiter
##  switch:
##   declaration prefixed with "|"
##   choices listed delimited by "|"
##   indicates that exactly one of the choices should appear
##  recursive prototype:
##   prototype definition prefixed with "/"
##   actual definition appears later and is one of scalar, list, or switch
##
## declared element names must be all letters in TitleCase. /[A-Z][A-Za-z]*/ I recommend TitleCase because they will be the names of Java classes.
##
## all elements must be declared or prototyped before they are referenced in a definition.
## scalars with head- or tail-recursion must specify a precedence in parentheses following the reference to the prototyped element.
##
## primitive elements: 
##  LITERAL - indicates a literal value (currently just integers)
##  ID - indicates an identifier.
##  NULL - indicates that nothing should appear
##
## literal elements:
##  elements specified in quotes (") signify keywords or symbol tokens

### only two types currently
|TypeId = "void" | "int" | "boolean"

### variable declaration
$VariableDeclaration = TypeId ID

### recursive expressions
/Expression

    ### binary operators (http://www.ibiblio.org/g2swap/byteofpython/read/operator-precedence.html)
    $Addition = Expression(120) "+" Expression(121)
    $Subtraction = Expression(120) "-" Expression(121)
    $Multiplication = Expression(130) "*" Expression(131)
    $Division = Expression(130) "/" Expression(131)
    $Equality = Expression(70) "==" Expression(71)
    $Inequality = Expression(70) "!=" Expression(71)
    |InfixOperation = Addition | Subtraction | Multiplication #| Division

    ### unary prefix operators
    #$Negation = "-" Expression(140)
    #|PrefixOperation = Negation

    |Operation = -InfixOperation # | -PrefixOperation

    #### function invocation
    #~Arguments = Expression : ","

    ### variable initialization
    $VariableCreation = VariableDeclaration "=" Expression

    ### Control Structures
    $IfThen = "if" Expression "then" Expression
    $IfThenElse = "if" Expression "then" Expression "else" Expression
    |ControlStructure = IfThen | IfThenElse

    ### controlStatement (none currently)
    #|ControlStatement = 

    ### block
    #|MaybeExpression = Expression | "void"
    ~BlockContents = Expression : ";"
    $Block = "{" BlockContents "}"

    $Assignment = ID "=" Expression

    #### try-catch-finally
    #$TryPart = "try" Expression

### function definition
