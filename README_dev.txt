Phases of compiling (see also Jaxc.comprehend()):
1. Tokenization (aka scanning, lexing, lexical analysis):
   Takes a String or array of bytes and produces an array of Tokens.
  - possible errors (non-terminal):
    * invalid source code characters (such as '`' and '#')
    * no closing single/double quote mark (same as invalid string/char literal characters (such as newlines))
    * invalid string/char literal escape sequence (such as '\a')
    * numeric literal overflow (such as 0x100000000 or 1e1000f)
2. Parsing (aka syntax analysis):
   Takes an array of Tokens and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (ast).
  - possible errors (terminal):
    * syntax error / parse error (such as one caused by "a + b c").
3. Semalysis ((portmanteau) aka semantic analysis):
   Examines an ast and fills in contextual information such as identifier resolution and type checking.
  - possible errors (terminal):
    * unresolved identifier
    * type checking
    * overload resolution
4. Staticalysis ((portmanteau) aka static code analysis, back-end analysis):
   Maniupulates a semalysized ast and predicts runtime behavior to find problems and optimizations.
  - possible errors (terminal):
    * uninitialized variables
    * unreachable code
    * functions must always return something
    * checked exceptions
  - possible warnings:
    * unused/unread variables(, parameters?)
    * unused/unread private members
    * reflexive assignment
    * pointless code (such as {5;})
  - possible optimizations:
    * constant propagation
    * constant folding
    * dead code removal
5. Code Generation: Takes a staticalysized ast and writes 1 or more .class files.
  - no language errors or warnings
  - possible file write errors


The parsing grammar of the language is coded out in "jax.jape". The class Parser and the classes in
net.wolfesoftware.java.jax.ast could almost be generated by a parser generator if it weren't for additional
fields in the classes (like FunctionDefinition.returnType). I don't have any plans to make a parser
generator for the .jape grammar.
